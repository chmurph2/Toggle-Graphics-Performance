# Toggle Graphics Performance

Toggle Graphics Performance is an AppleScript that makes it dead-simple to
toggle the "Energy Saver" system preference between "Better battery
life" and "Higher" graphics performance (on certain MacBook Pro models).

## Installation

Install the script by typing `rake install` in this directory. This will
compile the AppleScript into .scpt files and copy it into your
~/Library/Scripts folder.

## Usage

I run the script with [Launchbar](http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar).

You could also bind the script to a shortcut key in the system with an
application like [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) or a
[Quicksilver](http://github.com/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy) trigger.
